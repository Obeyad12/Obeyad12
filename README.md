# 👋 Hi, I'm Obeyad

I'm a **Computer Engineering student at Toronto Metropolitan University** with a strong foundation in software development, systems design, and building digital solutions that make a difference. I’ve worked on web and Android apps, database-driven analytics tools, and even hardware projects like creating a CPU from scratch.

🌟 **Quick Facts:**
- 🧠 I love learning fast—give me a challenge and I’ll master it.
- 💡 I thrive in pressure, bring original ideas, and constantly strive to improve.
- 🧑‍💻 Most recently, I built internal analytics tools on **Retool** and used **Supabase** for backend logic at **Civiconnect**.
- 📱 I developed an anime-style fitness app using **Flutter & Dart**, and worked on an **admin dashboard** for **Nurse Recruit**.
- 🔌 I’ve created a simple CPU using **VHDL** and done circuit design with **Quartus**.
